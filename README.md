## What's the issue?
------------------------
Today, most of the community review systems are owned by "Big" centralized organisations like Amazon, Google etc. These organisations when required often influence users contents on the platform to improve their odds in market. Also, due to centralized nature, present systems can be highly effected if the company went down.

## Proposed Solution?
--------------------------
So here we propose a solution to the problem by developing a Decentralized Review Platform using Ethereum Ecosystem. This enables us to deliver a temper-proof, highly reliable & trusted community platform for reviews & ratings. It's a community review system on which user can just write review for 'link' to the 'restaurants','hotels' ,'products' or 'websites'.

## Innovation?
---------------------------
It's gives power to each and every individual by assuring them that their voices cannot be put down by "Big" Organisations for their profit. Our system emphasis on user experience & simplicity by abstracting most of the technical aspects.

More on that, we will also integrate this system with Zulip Platform, to categorize all the reviews provided by the users into several categories/topics based on sentiments, product, etc. It'll help organisations to know about discussions going in their products & reach their customers.

## More...
----------------------------
We'll also create a modular "Disqus" like plugin named "Biscus" which can be added to any project page.

## What Technology Stack?
